        <h1>8-Ball</h1>
        <h2>APA League Rules</h2>
        <p>8-ball is played with a cue ball and normal rack of fifteen (15) object balls. Balls are
          racked with the front ball on the foot spot and the 8-ball in the center. The purpose of the game is for one
          player to pocket the solid colored group of balls numbered 1 to 7 or the striped balls from 9-15. Choice of balls
          to be pocketed is made by the player pocketing the first ball of the game. A player wins by pocketing all his
          object balls followed by legally pocketing the 8-ball in a marked pocket.</p>

          <h1>Lag</h1>
          <p>Method used to start a match. Players simultaneously shoot a ball from behind the headstring,
          banking it off the foot rail and back to the head of the table. Striking the side rails or any pocket results in the
          loss of the lag. The closest ball to the head rail wins. It is permissible to strike the head rain. If the lagged balls
          make contact with each other, lag over.</p>

          <h2>Breaking</h2>
          <p>"Breaking safe" or soft is not allowed. For a break to be legal, at least four balls must be driven
            to the rails or a ball must be pocketed. Otherwise, the balls are re-racked and re-broken by the same player. A
            game not legally broken but resulting in a scratch or foul will be re-racked and broken by the opposite player.
            The rack must be struck before a foul can occur. The head ball or the second ball must be struck on the break
            and the cue ball may not be shot into the rail before the rack. The League Operator may make judgments and
            issue penalties to teams and players who are not breaking hard. Breaking just hard enough lo comply with this
            rule is not a guarantee against penalties. Break as hard as you can with control.</p>

          <h1>After the Break</h1>
          <p>Various circumstances can occur upon completion of the break; they are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A foul in the break results in "Ball in hand" behind the headstring and the incoming player has an
              open table as defined in "Se." The incoming player must shoot any ball outside the headstring. A ball
              that's dead center or "out" is playable. 1f it is "in". the ball is not playable. It is up to the opponent to
              call the cue ball "in" before it is shot. (See Master League Manual for more complete explanation.)
            </li>
            <li>No balls are pocketed and it is the other player's turn.</li>
            <li>c. The 8-ball is made. resulting in a win, unless the player scratches.</li>
            <li>d. One ball is made, it is still the breaker's turn and he continues shooting the category of balls he just made.</li>
            <li>e. One of each type ball is made. The breaker has his choice of balls He may shoot any ball, except the
                8-ball, and each pocketed ball counts. If he makes one of each on his second shot, he still has an open
                table. If he misses on his second shot, his opponent has an "open table." "Open table" means a player
                can shoot a combination involving a stripe and a solid and whichever he makes would be his ball.
            </li>
            <li>If two balls of one type and one ball of the other type are pocketed, it is the shooter's choice just as in shown above.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Combination Shots</h2>
          <p>Combination shots are legal, but striking the correct ball first is required except in
            an "open table" situation. The 8-ball is not neutral. A player is credited with all balls he legal1y pockets. When
            a player does not pocket one of his balls but pocket's an opponent's ball, he looses his turn. The opponent gets
            credit for the pocketed ball. No pocketed ball is ever spotted.</p>

          <h1>Ball on the Floor</h1>
          <p>If the 8-ball is knocked on the floor , it is loss of game. Object balls knocked on the
            floor are spotted. If the spot is taken, the ball is placed on a line directly behind the spot as close as possible.
            Knocking a ball other than the cue ball on the floor is not a foul. It might occur that a player pockets his ball
            while simultaneously knocking another ball on the Roar. In the situation, it is still his tum and the ball is not
            spotted until he misses. If the ball on the floor is one of the shooter's balls, it is spotted when the shooter had
            pocketed all his other balls or misses.</p>

          <p>Balls must remain in a pocket to be legal. If a ball goes in a pocket, but bounces back
            onto the playing surface, it is not considered pocketed. If it is the 8-ball, it is not considered a win or loss. If it
            is the cue ball, it is not considered a scratch.</p>

            stick is available. League management cannot guarantee the presence of bridges and some host locations may
            not have them. There is no foul - simply stop the shooter and hand him the bridge.</p>

          <p>There are various ways to lose. Beware!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The opposing player pockets his numerical group and legally pockets the 8-ball.</li>
            <li>A player pockets the 8-ball out of tum or knocks it on the floor.</li>
            <li>A player pockets the 8-ball in the wrong pocket or fails to property mark the pocket</li>
            <li>When playing the 8-ball, a player scratches the cue ball.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Note!</b>
          <ul>
             <li>A player attempting to shoot the 8-ball but missing it has fouled, resulting in "ball in hand" for his opponent. This is NOT loss of game. </li>
            <li>. A game is forfeited if the shooter alters the course of the 8-ball or the cue ball in a game losing situation.</li>
